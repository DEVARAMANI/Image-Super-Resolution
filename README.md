# Image-Super-Resolution
Image noise removal, super resolution, blurry images, no light, etc. super resolution images. 
It is a well-studied problem in computer vision and image processing and is a testing ground for low-level image modeling algorithms. 
It aims to restore quality images from their degraded counterparts.

# Project Description
This project is done using Django (web development framework) and pytorch (machine learning framework).

# Requirements
1) Django
2) Pytorch
3) numpy
4) timm
5) OpenCV

# Steps to run the project
  (make sure you download the requirements)
   #1 Open the terminal at the root directory and type "py manage.py runserver".
   #2 You'll get the link in the terminal itself. You can copy the link and paste it into your favorite browser or Ctrl+click the link.
   #3 After visiting the link, you can explore the project and use it to convert low-resolution images to high-resolution.
